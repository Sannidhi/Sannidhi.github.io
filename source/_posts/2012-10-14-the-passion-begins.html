<br /><div class="p1">TWU continued on to week 2 and I joined the bootcamp for developers. I met other trainers - Nigel, Amir, Alok (Luka/Heroku) :) and I realized as the time passed that all TWers have one thing in common : They are awesomely&nbsp;brilliant!&nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">Yeah, it was intimidating.. My first internship I had a feeling (yes, it was true :P) that I was smarter than most people over there. For some it might be a great feeling, but for me I knew something was&nbsp;missing - the drive to excel.&nbsp;</div><div class="p2"><br /></div><div class="p1">At TW all the people around me are extraordinary - not because they come from best of the schools or&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;top grades - it was because they are extremely passionate about what they are doing.&nbsp;They are passionate about writing good code, about technology and about having serious fun :D&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/400798_10152203731790438_1106490818_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/400798_10152203731790438_1106490818_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">Bowling Night</span></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="p1">And they've passed it onto me - without much of an effort - I just know that I have never been as passionate about CS as I am now. How glad am I that I did choose TW eventually!&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">To quantify my passion - I am, for the first time ever, annoyed that it is a weekend! Oh weekday hope thy never end! :)&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">Yes, I've used 'passion' more times than is even allowed by&nbsp;Repetitio,&nbsp;but well what was the post again?&nbsp;</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1"><br /></div></div>
