Thank you Scott for giving me this idea. There are many resolutions I make in my head, but to put them down and try to stick to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> as much as possible, is what I am going to try to do this year.<br /><br />So here I go:<br /><div><h3><b>Read 1 technical book every 3 months.</b></h3>For this resolution, I have taken inspiration from the book <a href="http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer"> The Pragmatic Programmer</a> where the author gives ideas to developers to stay on top of their knowledge. A technical book could be anything that could improve my skills as a developer or go deeper into the patterns in a language I already know or simply tell me something about an area I'm totally unaware of.<br /><h3><b>Learn a new language + develop an app using it.</b></h3>My programming has been limited to using languages like Java or C. Though these are pretty strong languages by themselves, knowing more will help me chose the right language to solve a given problem. I want to start with Ruby/Python and then move to core functional languages like F#. To develop an app in it, is to put a measurable aspect to "learning" it.<br /><h3><b>Speak at a technical event in ThoughtWorks or outside.</b></h3><div>This resolution will help me target two of my weaknesses:</div><div>1. Fear of public speaking&nbsp;</div><div>2. Laziness to learn something difficult without being thrown into it. &nbsp;</div><h3><b>Write one blog post every month - at least!</b></h3></div><div><div>I started writing this blog when I realized I was learning so many new things and I needed an outlet for them. That in turn, helped me understand the concepts better. If I do not have anything to write about, means that I am not bursting with new ideas or learnings. Hence the pledge to keep writing will be a pledge to keep learning.<br /><br />By the way, hope this one counts as January :)&nbsp;</div></div></div>
