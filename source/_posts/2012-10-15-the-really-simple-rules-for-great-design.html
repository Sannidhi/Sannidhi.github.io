If you look up the word 'Developer' it says : One who programs computers to match the requirements of a given problem. I used to perfectly fit into this definition until I learnt the simple rules of design.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I have never been an artistic person but now I have a compulsive need for my code to look beautiful. I have started abiding by these set of rules and the code looks better, is easier to understand and the best part is it is so freaking 'simple'! <br /><div></div><div>For every little program you write just go over <b>these simple rules</b>:&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>It should pass all tests </b>- This is to make sure your program does what its supposed to. (If you don't have any tests, Stop reading further - Run to your computer write some tests and I'll see you in a bit)&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>It should reveal all intentions</b> - Does your add method do exactly (and only) that? Add?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>No duplication</b> - Extract common statements into methods, use setup() for test cases : do what it takes.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Fewest number of classes and methods</b> - I closely relate this to another rule "YAGNI" an acronym for 'You aren't gonna need it'. Cluttering the code with far too many classes will make it difficult to maintain.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This list is not exhaustive and good design is a far lengthy topic of discussion but if you have these 4 check boxes ticked and you write decent code it will be a great step 1 to having a robust design for your application.&nbsp;</div></div></div>
