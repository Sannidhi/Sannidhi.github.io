My first brush with Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology is at ThoughtWorks Inc. It is my first job out of school and I've never really written production quality code; as a result TDD came as a bit of a shock to me.<br /><br />Let me first explain what TDD means to me:<br /><br /><ul><li>It is a software dev method where in you ALWAYS write a test before you write any code to support it.&nbsp;</li><li>It follows a simple 3 step process called Red-Green-Refactor:</li></ul><ol><ol><li>Red - Write the test for your first requirement. Do the necessary changes for it to compile. Run it and let it fail. (Yes, let it.)</li><li>Green - Make the minimum number of changes for the test to pass.&nbsp;</li><li>Refactor - Now work on your code for it to pass all possible scenarios (not just the test cases you have, though you should have a test case for each type of a scenario) and make it production quality. And now deploy!</li></ol></ol><ul><li>Thus you just do not have any code that does not have tests to support it.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>At first, I thought it was just a mechanism to enforce tests for a code.. then why is it different from writing tests after writing code?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>To answer this I wrote 2 programs - one where I followed TDD and one where I used the&nbsp;traditional&nbsp;old school approach for the same story. Here is what I observed:&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>With TDD: The tests looked a LOT cleaner as I did not have any sort of logic within it. They had no information of the logic within the code and hence made the tests more robust.&nbsp;</li><li>With Traditional Approach: The tests were&nbsp;susceptible&nbsp;to breakage as any change in the code would mean I would need to change the tests too. The tests were written after the code and hence had to support the code whilst knowing what the control flow in the program is.</li></ul><div><br /></div>And yes, reading about it (or even writing) does not justify how awesome it is to use TDD. Like me, you will find your answers when you 'just try!'<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Tip: I am person who needs all the cards open in front before I can make any decision. Hence, it was difficult to visualize the code I am writing tests for. To overcome this problem, I have started writing little bits of code in my tests it self. Once the tests pass, I can transfer the code/logic over to the source files and the tests will remain as clean as they are meant to be. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>PS: I am so used to TDD now that when I need to see someones program, I look at the tests before looking at the code! #Woohoo</div></div>
