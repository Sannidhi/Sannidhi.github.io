<br />Steps to set up a continuous integration server using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/go-agile-release-management">Go</a>:&nbsp;(Why?&nbsp;<a href="http://mythoughtslam.blogspot.com/2012/11/continuous-integration.html">See this</a>)<br /><br />1. Log in to the machine where you want the continuous server to be hosted<br /><span style="color: #674ea7;">&nbsp; &nbsp; $ ssh root@I.P.Address&nbsp;</span><br />2. Download Go from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/go-agile-release-management/download">here</a>. Install both&nbsp;go server and go agent.<br />3. Start your agent<br /><span style="color: #674ea7;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$ go-agent start&nbsp;</span><br />4. Set up pipelines and stages to get the jobs done.<br /><br />Thats it, your integration server and agent is ready to "go" :)<br /><br />There are a couple of assumptions made in the 3 step process for setting it up such as:<br /><br />1. The machine where you are installing the go server already has the resources needed for it to build your code.<br />2. For ex, for the first project, we had a "mySQL, git, Java 1.6" stack. Hence we had to ensure that the machine also has the same versions of the softwares installed on them.<br /><br />Configuring the server manually should not be the way to go as you may need to do all these steps again if you are setting it up on some other machine. We can automate this process.<br /><br />A sample script to configure Go on a Cent OS machine:<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /># To unzip your downloads<br />yum install unzip -y<br /><br /># If you are using git as "material"<br />yum install git -y<br /><br /># The database you are using for your app<br />wget http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.5/mysql-5.5.28-osx10.6-x86_64.dmg/from/http://cdn.mysql.com/<br /><br /># If your are using Java, download the appropriate version<br />wget http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/6u37-b06/jdk-6u37-linux-i586-rpm.bin<br /><br /># Get the go server up<br />wget&nbsp;http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/installer/go-server-1232-jar<br /><br />#Get the go agent<br />wget&nbsp;http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/installer/go-agent-1232-jar<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Once the server and the agent are running (check port 8153) you can use the GUI to set up pipelines. (Or use the config file found under Admin-&gt;Configuration) More on how to set up your pipeline etc can be found in the documentation by clicking on help.<br /><br />Note: Your server must be running in order to access this page.<br /><br /><div>This was just a quick guide to getting started with a CI server. You might have to add more logic to the shell script to customize it to suite the needs of your app.&nbsp;</div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
